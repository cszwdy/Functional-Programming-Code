<p>Functions in Swift are <em>first-class values</em>, i.e. functions may be
passed as arguments to other functions, and functions may return new
functions. This idea may seem strange if you&#39;re used to working with
simple types, such as integers, booleans, or structs. In this chapter,
we will try to explain why first-class functions are useful and provide
our first example of functional programming in action.</p>
<h2 id="example-battleship">Example: Battleship</h2>
<p>We&#39;ll introduce first-class functions using a small example: a
non-trivial function that you might need to implement if you were
writing a Battleship-like game. The problem we&#39;ll look at boils down to
determining whether or not a given point is in range, without being too
close to friendly ships or to us.</p>
<p>As a first approximation, you might write a very simple function that
checks whether or not a point is in range. For the sake of simplicity,
we will assume that our ship is located at the origin. We can visualize
the region we want to describe in Figure \ref{fig:battleship1}.</p>
<p><em>Playgrounds don&#39;t contain images, please see the book</em></p>
<p>The first function we write, <code>inRange1</code>, checks that a point is in the
grey area in Figure \ref{fig:battleship1}. Using some basic geometry, we
can write this function as follows:</p>
