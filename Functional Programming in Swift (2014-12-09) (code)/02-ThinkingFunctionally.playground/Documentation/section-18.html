    <p>The call <code>shift(offset, region)</code> moves the region to the right and up by
<code>offet.x</code> and <code>offset.y</code>, respectively. We need to return a <code>Region</code>,
which is a function from a point to a boolean value. To do this, we
start writing another closure, introducing the point we need to check.
From this point, we compute a new point with the coordinates
<code>point.x - offset.x</code> and <code>point.y - offset.y</code>. Finally, we check that
this new point is in the <em>original</em> region by passing it as an argument
to the <code>region</code> function.</p>
<p>This is one of the core concepts of functional programming: rather than
creating increasingly complicated functions such as <code>circle2</code>, we have
written a function, <code>shift</code>, that modifies another function. For
example, a circle that&#39;s centered at <code>(5, 5)</code> and has a radius of <code>10</code>
can now be expressed like this:</p>
