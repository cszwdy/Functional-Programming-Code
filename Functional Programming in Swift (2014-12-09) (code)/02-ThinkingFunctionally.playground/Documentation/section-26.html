    <p>This example shows how Swift lets you compute and pass around functions
no differently than you would integers or booleans. This enables us to
write small primitives (such as <code>circle</code>) and to build a series of
functions on top of these primitives. Each of these functions modifies
or combines regions into new regions. Instead of writing complex
functions to solve a very specific problem, we can now use many small
functions that can be assembled to solve a wide variety of problems.</p>
<p>Now let&#39;s turn our attention back to our original example. With this
small library in place, we can now refactor the complicated <code>inRange</code>
function as follows:</p>
