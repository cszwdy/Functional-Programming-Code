can read the filters that are applied to an image from left to right —
like Unix pipes.</p>
<p>The filter composition operation that we have defined is an example of
<em>function composition</em>. In mathematics, the composition of the two
functions <code>f</code> and <code>g</code>, sometimes written <code>f ∘ g</code>, defines a new function
mapping an input to <code>x</code> to <code>f(g(x))</code>. With the exception of the order,
this is precisely what our <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> operator does: it passes an argument
image through its two constituent filters.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we&#39;ve seen that there are two ways to define a function
that takes two arguments. The first style is familiar to most
programmers:</p>
