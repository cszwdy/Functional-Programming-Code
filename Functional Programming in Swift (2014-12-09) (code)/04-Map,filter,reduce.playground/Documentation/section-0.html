<p>Functions that take functions as arguments are sometimes called
<em>higher-order</em> functions. In this chapter, we will tour some of the
higher-order functions on arrays from the Swift standard library. By
doing so, we will introduce Swift&#39;s <em>generics</em> and show how to assemble
complex computations on arrays.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-generics">Introducing Generics</h2>
<p>Suppose we need to write a function that, given an array of integers,
computes a new array, where every integer in the original array has been
incremented by one. Such a function is easy to write using a single
<code>for</code> loop:</p>
<pre><code>func incrementArray(xs: [Int]) -&gt; [Int] {
    var result: [Int] = []
    for x in xs {
        result.append(x + 1)
    }
    return result
}
</code></pre><p>Now suppose we also need a function that computes a new array, where
every element in the argument array has been doubled. This is also easy
to do using a <code>for</code> loop:</p>
<pre><code>func doubleArray1(xs: [Int]) -&gt; [Int] {
    var result: [Int] = []
    for x in xs {
        result.append(x * 2)
    }
    return result
}
</code></pre><p>Both of these functions share a lot of code. Can we abstract over the
differences and write a single, more general function that captures this
pattern? Such a function would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>func computeIntArray(xs: [Int]) -&gt; [Int] {
    var result: [Int] = []
    for x in xs {
        result.append(/* something using x */)
    }
    return result
}
</code></pre><p>To complete this definition, we need to add a new argument describing
how to compute a new integer from the individual elements of the array â€”
that is, we need to pass a function as an argument:</p>
