    <p>Note that we are using Swift&#39;s syntax for <a href="http://objc.io/fpinswift/6">trailing
closures</a> here â€” we provide the final
(closure) argument to <code>computeIntArray</code> after the parentheses containing
the other arguments.</p>
<p>This code is still not as flexible as it could be. Suppose we want to
compute a new array of booleans, describing whether the numbers in the
original array were even or not. We might try to write something like
this:</p>
<pre><code>func isEvenArray(xs: [Int]) -&gt; [Bool] {
    computeIntArray(xs) { x in x % 2 == 0 }
}
</code></pre><p>Unfortunately, this code gives a type error. The problem is that our
<code>computeIntArray</code> function takes an argument of type <code>Int -&gt; Int</code>, that
is, a function that returns an integer. In the definition of
<code>isEvenArray</code>, we are passing an argument of type <code>Int -&gt; Bool</code>, which
causes the type error.</p>
<p>How should we solve this? One thing we <em>could</em> do is define a new
version of <code>computeIntArray</code> that takes a function argument of type
<code>Int -&gt; Bool</code>. That might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>func computeBoolArray(xs: [Int], f: Int -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [Bool] {
    let result: [Bool] = []
    for x in xs {
        result.append(f(x))
    }
    return result
}
</code></pre><p>This doesn&#39;t scale very well though. What if we need to compute a
<code>String</code> next? Do we need to define yet another higher-order function,
expecting an argument of type <code>Int -&gt; String</code>?</p>
<p>Luckily, there is a solution to this problem: we can use
<a href="http://objc.io/fpinswift/7">generics</a>. The definitions of
<code>computeBoolArray</code> and <code>computeIntArray</code> are identical; the only
difference is in the <em>type signature</em>. If we were to define another
version, <code>computeStringArray</code>, the body of the function would be the
same again. In fact, the same code will work for <em>any</em> type. What we
really want to do is write a single generic function that will work for
every possible type:</p>
