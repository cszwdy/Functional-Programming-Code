    <p>We start by filtering out those cities that have less than one million
inhabitants. We then map our <code>scale</code> function over the remaining cities.
Finally, we compute a <code>String</code> with a list of city names and
populations, using the <code>reduce</code> function. Here we use the <code>map</code>,
<code>filter</code>, and <code>reduce</code> definitions from the <code>Array</code> type in Swift&#39;s
standard library. As a result, we can chain together the results of our
maps and filters nicely. The <code>cities.filter(..)</code> expression computes an
array, on which we call <code>map</code>; we call <code>reduce</code> on the result of this
call to obtain our final result.</p>
<h2 id="generics-vs-the-any-type">Generics vs. the <code>Any</code> Type</h2>
<p>Aside from generics, Swift also supports an <code>Any</code> type that can
represent <a href="http://objc.io/fpinswift/8">values of any type</a>. On the
surface, this may seem similar to generics. Both the <code>Any</code> type and
generics can be used to define functions accepting different types of
arguments. However, it is very important to understand the difference:
generics can be used to define flexible functions, the types of which
are still checked by the compiler; the <code>Any</code> type can be used to dodge
Swift&#39;s type system (and should be avoided whenever possible).</p>
<p>Let&#39;s consider the simplest possible example, which is a function that
does nothing but return its argument. Using generics, we might write the
following:</p>
