    <p>The type of this function is so generic that it completely determines
how the <em>function itself</em> is defined. We&#39;ll try to give an informal
argument here. We need to produce a value of type <code>C</code>. As there is
nothing else we know about <code>C</code>, there is no value that we can return
immediately. If we knew that <code>C</code> was some concrete type, like <code>Int</code> or
<code>Bool</code>, we could potentially return a value of that type, such as <code>5</code> or
<code>True</code>, respectively. As our function must work <em>for any</em> type <code>C</code>, we
cannot do so. The only argument to the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> operator that refers to <code>C</code>
is the function <code>g : B -&gt; C</code>. Therefore, the only way to get our hands
on a value of type <code>C</code> is by applying the function <code>g</code> to a value of
type <code>B</code>.</p>
<p>Similarly, the only way to produce a <code>B</code> is by applying <code>f</code> to a value
of type <code>A</code>. The only value of type <code>A</code> that we have is the final
argument to our operator. Therefore, this definition of function
composition is the only possible function that has this generic type.</p>
<p>In the same way, we can define a generic function that curries any
function expecting a tuple of two arguments, thereby producing the
corresponding curried version:</p>
