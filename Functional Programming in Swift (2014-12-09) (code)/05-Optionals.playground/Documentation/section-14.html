    <p>Of course, we can also use <code>map</code> to project fields or methods from
optional structs and classes, similar to the <code>?</code> operator.</p>
<p>Why is this function called <code>map</code>? What does it have to do with array
computations? There is a good reason for calling both of these functions
<code>map</code>, but we will defer this discussion for the moment. In <a href="#functors-applicative-functors-and-monads">Chapter
14</a>, we will explain the
relation in greater detail.</p>

<p>The <code>map</code> function shows one way to manipulate optional values, but many
others exist. Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code>let x: Int? = 3
let y: Int? = nil
let z: Int? = x + y
</code></pre><p>This program is not accepted by the Swift compiler. Can you spot the
error?</p>
<p>The problem is that addition only works on <code>Int</code> values, rather than the
optional <code>Int?</code> values we have here. To resolve this, we would have to
introduce nested <code>if</code> statements, as follows:</p>
<pre><code>func addOptionals(optionalX: Int?, optionalY: Int?) -&gt; Int? {
    if let x = optionalX {
        if let y = optionalY {
            return x + y
        }
    }
    return nil
}
</code></pre><p>This may seem like a contrived example, but manipulating optional values
can happen all the time. Suppose we have the following dictionary,
associating countries with their capital cities:</p>
