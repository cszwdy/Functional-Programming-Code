    <p>We do not want to advocate that <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> is the &#39;right&#39; way to combine
optional values. Instead, we hope to show that optional binding is not
magically built-in to the Swift compiler, but rather a control structure
you can implement yourself using a higher-order function.</p>
<h2 id="why-optionals-">Why Optionals?</h2>
<p>What&#39;s the point of introducing an explicit optional type? For
programmers used to Objective-C, working with optional types may seem
strange at first. The Swift type system is rather rigid: whenever we
have an optional type, we have to deal with the possibility of it being
<code>nil</code>. We have had to write new functions like <code>map</code> to manipulate
optional values. In Objective-C, you have more flexibility. For
instance, when translating the example above to Objective-C, there is no
compiler error:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-objc">- (int)populationOfCapital:(NSString *)country 
{
    return [self.cities[self.capitals[country]] intValue] * 1000;
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can pass in <code>nil</code> for the name of a country, and we get back a result
of <code>0.0</code>. Everything is fine. In many languages without optionals, null
pointers are a source of danger. Much less so in Objective-C. In
Objective-C, you can safely send messages to <code>nil</code>, and depending on the
return type, you either get <code>nil</code>, 0, or similar “zero-like” values. Why
change this behavior in Swift?</p>
<p>The choice for an explicit optional type fits with the increased static
safety of Swift. A strong type system catches errors before code is
executed, and an explicit optional type helps protect you from
unexpected crashes arising from missing values.</p>
<p>The default zero-like behavior employed by Objective-C has its
drawbacks. You may want to distinguish between failure (a key is not in
the dictionary) and success-returning <code>nil</code> (a key is in the dictionary,
but associated with <code>nil</code>). To do that in Objective-C, you have to use
<code>NSNull</code>.</p>
<p>While it is safe in Objective-C to send messages to <code>nil</code>, it is often
not safe to use them. Let&#39;s say we want to create an attributed string.
If we pass in <code>nil</code> as the argument for <code>country</code>, the <code>capital</code> will
also be <code>nil</code>, but <code>NSAttributedString</code> will crash when trying to
initialize it with a <code>nil</code> value:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-objc">- (NSAttributedString *)attributedCapital:(NSString *)country 
{
    NSString *capital = self.capitals[country];
    NSDictionary *attributes = @{ /* ... */ };
    return [[NSAttributedString alloc] initWithString:capital 
                                           attributes:attributes];
}
</code></pre>
<p>While crashes like that don&#39;t happen too often, almost every developer
has had code like this crash. Most of the time, these crashes are
detected during debugging, but it is very possible to ship code without
noticing that, in some cases, a variable might unexpectedly be <code>nil</code>.
Therefore, many programmers use asserts to verify this behavior. For
example, we can add an <code>NSParameterAssert</code> to make sure we crash quickly
when the <code>country</code> is <code>nil</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-objc">- (NSAttributedString *)attributedCapital:(NSString *)country 
{
    NSParameterAssert(country);
    NSString *capital = self.capitals[country];
    NSDictionary *attributes = @{ /* ... */ };
    return [[NSAttributedString alloc] initWithString:capital 
                                           attributes:attributes];
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, when we pass in a country value that is <code>nil</code>, the assert fails
immediately, and we are almost certain to hit this during debugging. But
what if we pass in a <code>country</code> value that doesn&#39;t have a matching key in
<code>self.capitals</code>? This is much more likely, especially when <code>country</code>
comes from user input. In that case, <code>capital</code> will be <code>nil</code> and our
code will still crash. Of course, this can be fixed easily enough. The
point is, however, that it is easier to write <em>robust</em> code using <code>nil</code>
in Swift than in Objective-C.</p>
<p>Finally, using these assertions is inherently non-modular. Suppose we
implement a <code>checkCountry</code> method that checks that a non-empty
<code>NSString*</code> is supported. We can incorporate this check easily enough:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-objc">- (NSAttributedString *)attributedCapital:(NSString*)country 
{
    NSParameterAssert(country);
    if (checkCountry(country)) {
        // ...
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now the question arises: should the <code>checkCountry</code> function also assert
that its argument is non-<code>nil</code>? On one hand, it should not — we have
just performed the check in the <code>attributedCapital</code> method. On the other
hand, if the <code>checkCountry</code> function only works on non-<code>nil</code> values, we
should duplicate the assertion. We are forced to choose between exposing
an unsafe interface or duplicating assertions. It is also possible to
add a <code>nonnull</code> attribute to the signature, which will emit a warning
when the method is called with a value that could be <code>nil</code>, but this is
not common practice in most Objective-C codebases.</p>
<p>In Swift, things are a bit better. Function signatures using optionals
explicitly state which values may be <code>nil</code>. This is invaluable
information when working with other peoples&#39; code. A signature like the
following provides a lot of information:</p>
<pre><code>func attributedCapital(country: String) -&gt; NSAttributedString?
</code></pre><p>Not only are we warned about the possibility of failure, but we know
that we must pass a <code>String</code> as argument — and not a <code>nil</code> value. A
crash like the one we described above will not happen. Furthermore, this
is information <em>checked</em> by the compiler. Documentation goes out of date
easily; you can always trust function signatures.</p>
<p>When dealing with scalar values, optionality is even more tricky in
Objective-C. Consider the following sample, that tries to find mentions
of a specific keyword in a string. It looks innocent enough: if
<code>rangeOfString:</code> does not find the string, then the location will be set
to <code>NSNotFound</code>. <code>NSNotFound</code> is defined as -1. This code is almost
correct, and the problem is hard to see at first sight: when
<code>someString</code> is <code>nil</code>, then <code>rangeOfString:</code> will return a structure
filled with zeroes, and the <code>location</code> will return 0. The check will
then succeed, and the code inside the if-statement will be executed:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-objc">NSString *someString = ...; 
if ([someString rangeOfString:@&quot;swift&quot;].location != NSNotFound]) {
    NSLog(@&quot;Someone mentioned swift!&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>With optionals, this can not happen. If we wanted to port this code to
Swift, we would need to make some structural changes. The above code
would be rejected by the compiler, and the type system would not allow
you to run <code>rangeOfString:</code> on a <code>nil</code> value. Instead, you first need to
unwrap it:</p>
<pre><code>if let someString = ... {
    if someString.rangeOfString(&quot;swift&quot;).location != NSNotFound {
        println(&quot;Found&quot;)
    }
}
</code></pre><p>The type system will help in catching subtle errors for you. Some of
these errors would have been easily detected during development, but
others might accidentally end up in production code. By using optionals,
this class of errors can be eliminated automatically.</p>
