    <p>Of course, there are many other similar properties of standard
arithmetic that we can test. We will cover more interesting tests and
properties shortly. Before we do so, however, we will give some more
details about how QuickCheck is implemented.</p>
<h2 id="building-quickcheck">Building QuickCheck</h2>
<p>In order to build our Swift implementation of QuickCheck, we will need
to do a couple of things.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we need a way to generate random values for different types.</li>
<li>Using these random value generators, we need to implement the
<code>check</code> function, which passes random values to its argument
property.</li>
<li>If a test fails, we would like to make the test input as small as
possible. For example, if our test fails on an array with 100
elements, we&#39;ll try to make it smaller and see if the test still
fails.</li>
<li>Finally, we&#39;ll need to do some extra work to make sure our check
function works on types that have generics.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="generating-random-values">Generating Random Values</h3>
<p>First, let&#39;s define a <a href="http://objc.io/fpinswift/13">protocol</a> that knows
how to generate arbitrary values. This protocol contains only one
function, <code>arbitrary</code>, which returns a value of type <code>Self</code>, i.e. an
instance of the class or struct that implements the <code>Arbitrary</code>
protocol:</p>
<pre><code>protocol Arbitrary {
    class func arbitrary() -&gt; Self
}
</code></pre><p>So let&#39;s write an instance for <code>Int</code>. We use the <code>arc4random</code> function
from the standard library and convert it into an <code>Int</code>. Note that this
only generates positive integers. A real implementation of the library
would generate negative integers as well, but we&#39;ll try to keep things
simple in this chapter:</p>
