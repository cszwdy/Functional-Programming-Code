    <h2 id="using-quickcheck">Using QuickCheck</h2>
<p>Somewhat counterintuitively, there is strong evidence to suggest that
testing technology influences the design of your code. People who rely
on <em>test-driven design</em> use tests not only to verify that their code is
correct. Instead, they also report that by writing your code in a
test-driven fashion, the design of the code gets simpler. This makes
sense â€” if it is easy to write a test for a class without having a
complicated setup procedure, it means that the class is nicely
decoupled.</p>
<p>For QuickCheck, the same rules apply. It will often not be easy to take
existing code and add QuickCheck tests as an afterthought, particularly
when you have an existing object-oriented architecture that relies
heavily on other classes or makes use of mutable state. However, if you
start by doing test-driven development using QuickCheck, you will see
that it strongly influences the design of your code. QuickCheck forces
you to think of the abstract properties that your functions must satisfy
and allows you to give a high-level specification. A unit test can
assert that <code>3 + 0</code> is equal to <code>0 + 3</code>; a QuickCheck property states
more generally that addition is a commutative operation. By thinking
about a high-level QuickCheck specification first, your code is more
likely to be biased toward modularity and <em>referential transparency</em>
(which we will cover in the <a href="#the-value-of-immutability">next chapter</a>).
QuickCheck does not work as well on stateful functions or APIs. As a
result, writing your tests up front with QuickCheck will help keep your
code clean.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>This library is far from complete, but already quite useful. That said,
there are a couple of obvious things that could be improved upon:</p>
<ul>
<li>The shrinking is naive. For example, in the case of arrays, we
currently remove the first element of the array. However, we might
also choose to remove a different element, or make the elements of
the array smaller (or do all of that). The current implementation
returns an optional shrunken value, whereas we might want to
generate a list of values. In a <a href="#generators-and-sequences">later
chapter</a>, we will see how to generate a
lazy list of results, and we could use that same technique here.</li>
<li>The <code>Arbitrary</code> instances are quite simple. For different data
types, we might want to have more complicated arbitrary instances.
For example, when generating arbitrary enum values, we could
generate certain cases with different frequencies. We could also
generate constrained values, such as sorted or non-empty arrays.
When writing multiple <code>Arbitrary</code> instances, it&#39;s possible to define
some helper functions that aid us in writing these instances.</li>
<li>Classify the generated test data: if we generate a lot of arrays of
length one, we could classify this as a &#39;trivial&#39; test case. The
Haskell library has support for classification, so these ideas could
be ported directly.</li>
<li>We might want better control of the size of the random input that is
generated. In the Haskell version of QuickCheck, the <code>Arbitrary</code>
protocol takes an additional size argument, limiting the size of the
random input generated; the <code>check</code> function than starts testing
&#39;small&#39; values, which correspond to small and fast tests. As more
and more tests pass, the <code>check</code> function increases the size to try
and find larger, more complicated counterexamples.</li>
<li>We might also want to initialize the random generator with an
explicit seed, and make it possible to replay the generation of test
cases. This will make it easier to reproduce failing tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, that&#39;s not everything; there are many other small and large
things that could be improved upon to make this into a full library.</p>
