    <p>When assigned to a new variable or passed to a function, value types are
<em>always</em> copied, whereas reference types are <em>not</em>. Instead, a reference
to the existing object or instance is used. Any changes to this
reference will also mutate the original object or instance.</p>
<p>Andy Matuschak provides some very useful intuition for the difference
between value types and reference types in <a href="http://objc.io/fpinswift/14">his article for
objc.io</a>.</p>
<p>Structs are not the only value type in Swift. In fact, almost all the
types in Swift are value types, including arrays, dictionaries, numbers,
booleans, tuples, and enums (the latter will be covered in the coming
chapter). Classes are the exception, rather than the rule. This is one
example of how Swift is moving away from object-oriented programming in
favor of other programming paradigms.</p>
<p>We will discuss the relative merits of classes and structs later on in
this section; before we do so, we want to briefly discuss the
interaction between the different forms of mutability that we have seen
thus far.</p>
<h3 id="structs-and-classes-mutable-or-not-">Structs and Classes: Mutable or Not?</h3>
<p>In the examples above, we have declared all our points and their fields
to be mutable, using <code>var</code> rather than <code>let</code>. The interaction between
compound types, such as structs and classes, and the <code>var</code> and <code>let</code>
declarations, requires some explanation.</p>
<p>Suppose we create the following immutable <code>PointStruct</code>:</p>
