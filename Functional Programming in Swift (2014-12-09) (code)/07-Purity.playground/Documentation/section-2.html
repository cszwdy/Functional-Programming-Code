    <p>The crucial difference is that we can assign new values to variables
declared using <code>var</code>, whereas variables created using <code>let</code> <em>cannot</em>
change:</p>
<pre><code>x = 3 // This is fine
y = 4 // This is rejected by the compiler
</code></pre><p>We will refer to variables declared using a <code>let</code> as <em>immutable</em>
variables; variables declared using a <code>var</code>, on the other hand, are said
to be <em>mutable</em>.</p>
<p>Why — you might wonder — would you ever declare an immutable variable?
Doing so limits the variable&#39;s capabilities. A mutable variable is
strictly more versatile. There is a clear case for preferring <code>var</code> over
<code>let</code>. Yet in this section, we want to try and argue that the opposite
is true.</p>
<p>Imagine having to read through a Swift class that someone else has
written. There are a few methods that all refer to an instance variable
with some meaningless name, say <code>x</code>. Given the choice, would you prefer
<code>x</code> to be declared with a <code>var</code> or a <code>let</code>? Clearly declaring <code>x</code> to be
immutable is preferable: you can read through the code without having to
worry about what the <em>current</em> value of <code>x</code> is, you&#39;re free to
substitute <code>x</code> for its definition, and you cannot invalidate <code>x</code> by
assigning it some value that might break invariants on which the rest of
the class relies.</p>
<p>Immutable variables may not be assigned a new value. As a result, it is
<em>easier</em> to reason about immutable variables. In his famous paper, &quot;Go
To Statement Considered Harmful,&quot; Edgar Dijkstra writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My... remark is that our intellectual powers are rather geared to
master static relations and that our powers to visualize processes
evolving in time are relatively poorly developed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dijkstra goes on to argue that the mental model a programmer needs to
develop when reading through structured code (using conditionals, loops,
and function calls, but not goto statements) is simpler than spaghetti
code full of gotos. We can take this discipline even further and eschew
the use of mutable variables: <code>var</code> considered harmful.</p>
<h2 id="value-types-vs-reference-types">Value Types vs. Reference Types</h2>
<p>The careful treatment of mutability is not present only in variable
declarations. Swift distinguishes between <em>value</em> types and <em>reference</em>
types. The canonical examples of value and reference types are structs
and classes, respectively. To illustrate the difference between value
types and reference types, we will define the following struct:</p>
