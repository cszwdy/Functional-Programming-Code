<p>The concept of mutability and immutability should already be familiar to
many Objective-C programmers. Many of the data structures provided by
Apple&#39;s Core Foundation and Foundation frameworks exist in immutable and
mutable variants, such as <code>NSArray</code> and <code>NSMutableArray</code>, <code>NSString</code> and
<code>NSMutableString</code>, and others. Using the immutable types is the default
choice in most cases, just as Swift favors value types over reference
types.</p>
<p>In contrast to Swift, however, there is no foolproof way to enforce
immutability in Objective-C. We could declare the object&#39;s properties as
read-only (or only expose an interface that avoids mutation), but this
will not stop us from (unintentionally) mutating values internally after
they have been initialized. When working with legacy code, for instance,
it is all too easy to break assumptions about mutability that cannot be
enforced by the compiler. Without checks by the compiler, it is very
hard to enforce any kind of discipline in the use of mutable variables.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we have seen how Swift distinguishes between mutable
and immutable values, and between value types and reference types. In
this final section, we want to explain <em>why</em> these are important
distinctions.</p>
<p>When studying a piece of software, <em>coupling</em> measures the degree to
which individual units of code depend on one another. Coupling is one of
the single most important factors that determines how well software is
structured. In the worst case, all classes and methods refer to one
another, sharing numerous mutable variables, or even relying on exact
implementation details. Such code can be very hard to maintain or
update: instead of understanding or modifying a small code fragment in
isolation, you constantly need to consider the system in its totality.</p>
<p>In Objective-C and many other object-oriented languages, it is common
for class methods to be coupled through shared instance variables. As a
result, however, mutating the variable may change the behavior of the
class&#39;s methods. Typically, this is a good thing — once you change the
data stored in an object, all its methods may refer to its new value. At
the same time, however, such shared instance variables introduce
coupling between all the class&#39;s methods. If any of these methods or
some external function invalidate the shared state, all the class&#39;s
methods may exhibit buggy behavior. It is much harder to test any of
these methods in isolation, as they are now coupled to one another.</p>
<p>Now compare this to the functions that we tested in the
<a href="#quickcheck">QuickCheck</a> chapter. Each of these functions computed an
output value that <em>only</em> depended on the input values. Such functions
that compute the same output for equal inputs are sometimes called
<em>referentially transparent</em>. By definition, referentially transparent
methods are loosely coupled from their environments: there are no
implicit dependencies on any state or variables, aside from the
function&#39;s arguments. Consequently, referentially transparent functions
are easier to test and understand in isolation. Furthermore, we can
compose, call, and assemble functions that are referentially transparent
without losing this property. Referential transparency is a guarantee of
modularity and reusability.</p>
<p>Referential transparency increases modularity on all levels. Imagine
reading through an API, trying to figure out how it works. The
documentation may be sparse or out of date. But if you know the API is
free of mutable state — all variables are declared using <code>let</code> rather
than <code>var</code> — this is incredibly valuable information. You never need to
worry about initializing objects or processing commands in exactly the
right order. Instead, you can just look at types of the functions and
constants that the API defines, and how these can be assembled to
produce the desired value.</p>
<p>Swift&#39;s distinction between <code>var</code> and <code>let</code> enables programmers not only
to distinguish between mutable and immutable data, but also to have the
compiler enforce this distinction. Favoring <code>let</code> over <code>var</code> reduces the
complexity of the program — you no longer have to worry about what the
current value of mutable variables is, but can simply refer to their
immutable definitions. Favoring immutability makes it easier to write
referentially transparent functions, and ultimately, reduces coupling.</p>
<p>Similarly, Swift&#39;s distinction between value types and reference types
encourages you to distinguish between mutable objects that may change
and immutable data that your program manipulates. Functions are free to
copy, change, or share values — any modifications will only ever affect
their local copies. Once again, this helps write code that is more
loosely coupled, as any dependencies resulting from shared state or
objects can be eliminated.</p>
<p>Can we do without mutable variables entirely? Pure programming
languages, such as Haskell, encourage programmers to avoid using mutable
state altogether. There are certainly large Haskell programs that do not
use any mutable state. In Swift, however, dogmatically avoiding <code>var</code> at
all costs will not necessarily make your code better. There are plenty
of situations where a function uses some mutable state internally.
Consider the following example function that sums the elements of an
array:</p>
