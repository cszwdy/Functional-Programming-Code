<p>So far, we have seen how Swift&#39;s enumerations can be used to describe a
choice between several different alternatives. The <code>Encoding</code>
enumeration provided a safe, typed representation of different string
encoding schemes. There are, however, many more applications of
enumerations.</p>
<p>Suppose that we want to write Swift wrappers around the existing
Objective-C methods to read and write files. Functions that might return
an error, such as the <code>NSString</code>&#39;s initializer below, can be a bit
clunky. In addition to the file path and string encoding, it requires a
third argument: a pointer to memory for potential error messages. In
Swift, we can use an optional type to provide a slightly simpler
interface:</p>
