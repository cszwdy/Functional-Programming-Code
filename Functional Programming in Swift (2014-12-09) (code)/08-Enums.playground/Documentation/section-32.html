<p>As we mentioned previously, enumerations are often referred to as sum
types. This may be a confusing name, as enumerations seem to have no
relation to numbers. Yet if you dig a little deeper, you may find that
enumerations and tuples have mathematical structure, very similar to
arithmetic.</p>
<p>Before we explore this structure, we need to consider the question of
when two types are the same. This may seem like a very strange question
to ask — isn&#39;t it obvious that <code>String</code> and <code>String</code> are equal, but
<code>String</code> and <code>Int</code> are not? However, as soon as you add generics,
enumerations, structs, and functions to the mix, the answer is not so
obvious. Such a simple question is still the subject of active research
exploring the <a href="http://objc.io/fpinswift/16">very foundations of
mathematics</a>. For the purpose of this
subsection, we will study when two types are <em>isomorphic</em>.</p>
<p>Intuitively, the two types <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are isomorphic if we can convert
between them without losing any information. We need to have two
functions, <code>f : A -&gt; B</code> and <code>g : B -&gt; A</code>, which are the inverse of one
another. More specifically, for <code>x : A</code>, the result of calling <code>g(f(x))</code>
must be equal to <code>x</code>; similarly, for all <code>y : B</code>, the result of
<code>f(g(y))</code> must be equal to <code>y</code>. This definition crystallizes the
intuition we stated above: we can convert freely between the types <code>A</code>
and <code>B</code> using <code>f</code> and <code>g</code>, without ever losing information (as we can
always undo <code>f</code> using <code>g</code>, and vice versa). This definition is not
precise enough for most programming purposes — 64 bits can be used to
represent integers or memory addresses, even if these are two very
different concepts. They will be useful, however, as we study the
algebraic structure of types.</p>
<p>To begin with, consider the following enumeration:</p>
