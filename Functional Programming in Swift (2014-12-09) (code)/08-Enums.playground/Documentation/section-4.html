    <p>We have chosen to restrict ourselves to the first four possibilities
defined in the <code>NSStringEncoding</code> enumeration listed above â€” there are
many common encodings that we have not incorporated in this definition.
This Swift enumeration declaration is for the purpose of illustration
only. The <code>Encoding</code> type is inhabited by four possible values: <code>ASCII</code>,
<code>NEXTSTEP</code>, <code>JapaneseEUC</code>, and <code>UTF8</code>. We will refer to the possible
values of an enumeration as <em>member values</em>, or <em>members</em> for short. In
a great deal of literature, such enumerations are sometimes called <em>sum
types</em>. Throughout this book, however, we will use Apple&#39;s terminology.</p>
<p>In contrast to Objective-C, the following code is <em>not</em> accepted by the
compiler:</p>
<pre><code>let myEncoding = Encoding.ASCII + Encoding.UTF8
</code></pre><p>Unlike Objective-C, enumerations in Swift create new types, distinct
from integers or other existing types.</p>
<p>We can define functions that calculate with encodings using <code>switch</code>
statements. For example, we may want to compute the <code>NSStringEncoding</code>
corresponding to our encoding enumeration:</p>
