    <p>Note that in the <code>Node</code> case for the <code>isEmptySet</code> function, we do not
need to refer to the subtrees or the value stored at the node, but can
immediately return <code>false</code>. Correspondingly, we can put wildcard
patterns for the three values associated with a <code>Node</code>, indicating they
are not used in this case branch.</p>
<p>If we try to write naive versions of <code>setInsert</code> and <code>setContains</code>,
however, it seems that we have not gained much. If we restrict ourselves
to <em>binary search trees</em>, however, we can perform much better. A
(non-empty) tree is said to be a binary search tree if all of the
following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>all the values stored in the left subtree are <em>less</em> than the value
stored at the root</li>
<li>all the values stored in the right subtree are <em>greater</em> than the
value stored at the root</li>
<li>both the left and right subtrees are binary search trees</li>
</ul>
<p>We can write an (inefficient) check to ascertain if a <code>Tree</code> is a binary
search tree or not:</p>
