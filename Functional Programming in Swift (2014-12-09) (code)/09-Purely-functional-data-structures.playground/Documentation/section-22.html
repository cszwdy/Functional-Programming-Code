    <p>Instead of checking whether or not the element occurs, <code>setInsert</code> finds
a suitable location to add the new element. If the tree is empty, it
builds a tree with a single element. If the element is already present,
it returns the original tree. Otherwise, the <code>setInsert</code> function
continues recursively, navigating to a suitable location to insert the
new element.</p>
<p>The worst-case performance of <code>setInsert</code> and <code>setContains</code> on binary
search trees is still linear — after all, we could have a very
unbalanced tree, where every left subtree is empty. More clever
implementations, such as 2-3 trees, AVL trees, or red-black trees, avoid
this by maintaining the invariant that each tree is suitably balanced.
Furthermore, we haven&#39;t written a <code>delete</code> operation, which would also
require rebalancing. These are tricky operations for which there are
plenty of well-documented implementations in the literature — once
again, this example serves as an illustration of working with recursive
enumerations and does not pretend to be a complete library.</p>
<h2 id="autocompletion-using-tries">Autocompletion Using Tries</h2>
<p>Now that we&#39;ve seen binary trees, this last section will cover a more
advanced and purely functional data structure. Suppose that we want to
write our own autocompletion algorithm — given a history of searches and
the prefix of the current search, we should compute an array of possible
completions.</p>
<p>Using arrays, the solution is entirely straightforward:</p>
<pre><code>func autocomplete(history: [String], 
                   textEntered: String) -&gt; [String] {

    return history.filter { string in 
        string.hasPrefix(textEntered)
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Unfortunately, this function is not very efficient. For large histories
and long prefixes, it may be too slow. Once again, we could improve
performance by keeping the history sorted and using some kind of binary
search on the history array. Instead, we will explore a different
solution, using a custom data structure tailored for this kind of query.</p>
<p><em>Tries</em>, also known as digital search trees, are a particular kind of
ordered tree. Typically, tries are used to look up a string, which
consists of a list of characters. Instead of storing strings in a binary
search tree, it can be more efficient to store them in a structure that
repeatedly branches over the strings&#39; constituent characters.</p>
<p>Previously, the binary <code>Tree</code> type had two subtrees at every node.
Tries, on the other hand, do not have a fixed number of subtrees at
every node, but instead (potentially) have subtrees for every character.
For example, we could visualize a trie storing the string &quot;cat,&quot; &quot;car,&quot;
&quot;cart,&quot; and &quot;dog&quot; as follows:</p>
<p><em>Playgrounds don&#39;t contain images, please see the book</em></p>
<p>To determine if the string &quot;care&quot; is in the trie, we follow the path
from the root, along the edges labeled &#39;c,&#39; &#39;a,&#39; and &#39;r.&#39; As the node
labeled &#39;r&#39; does not have a child labeled with &#39;e,&#39; the string &quot;care&quot; is
not in this trie. The string &quot;cat&quot; is in the trie, as we can follow a
path from the root along edges labeled &#39;c,&#39; &#39;a,&#39; and &#39;t.&#39;</p>
<p>How can we represent such tries in Swift? As a first attempt, we write a
struct storing a dictionary, mapping characters to subtries at every
node:</p>
<pre><code>struct Trie {
    let children : [Character: Trie]
}
</code></pre><p>There are two improvements we would like to make to this definition.
First of all, we need to add some additional information to the node.
From the example trie above, you can see that by adding &quot;cart&quot; to the
trie, all the prefixes of &quot;cart&quot; — namely &quot;c,&quot; &quot;ca,&quot; and &quot;car&quot; — also
appear in the trie. As we may want to distinguish between prefixes that
are or are not in the trie, we will add an additional boolean, <code>isElem</code>,
to every node. This boolean indicates whether or not the current string
is in the trie. Finally, we can define a generic trie that is no longer
restricted to only storing characters. Doing so yields the following
definition of tries:</p>
