    <p>This function is a bit tricky. It starts by checking if the current root
is marked as a member of the trie or not. If it is, the trie contains
the empty key; if it is not, the <code>result</code> variable is initialized to the
empty array. Next, it traverses the dictionary, computing the elements
of the subtries — this is done by the call <code>elements(value)</code>. Finally,
the &#39;character&#39; associated with every subtrie is added to the front of
the elements of that subtrie — this is taken care of by the <code>map</code>
function.</p>
<p>Next, we would like to define lookup and insertion functions. Before we
do so, however, we will need a few auxiliary functions. We have
represented keys as an array. While our tries are defined as (recursive)
structs, arrays are not. Yet it can still be useful to traverse an array
recursively. To make this a bit easier, we define the following
extension on arrays:</p>
