    <p>While simple, the drawback of this implementation is that many of the
operations perform linearly in the size of the set. For large sets, this
may cause performance problems.</p>
<p>There are several possible ways to improve performance. For example, we
could ensure the array is sorted and use binary search to locate
specific elements. Instead, we will define a <em>binary search tree</em> to
represent our sets. We can build a tree structure in the traditional C
style, maintaining pointers to subtrees at every node. However, we can
also define such trees directly as an enumeration in Swift, using the
