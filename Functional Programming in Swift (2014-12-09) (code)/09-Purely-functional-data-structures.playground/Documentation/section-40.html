    <p>To compute all the strings in a trie with a given prefix, we simply call
the <code>withPrefix</code> function and extract the elements from the resulting
trie, if it exists. If there is no subtrie with the given prefix, we
simply return the empty array.</p>
<p>To complete the library, you may still want to write insertion and
deletion functions yourself.</p>

<p>These are but two examples of writing efficient, immutable data
structures using enumerations and structs. There are many others in
Chris Okasaki&#39;s <em>Purely Functional Data Structures</em> [-@okasaki], which
is a standard reference on the subject. Interested readers may also want
to read Ralph Hinze and Ross Paterson&#39;s work on finger trees
[-@hinze-paterson], which are general-purpose purely functional data
structures with numerous applications. Finally,
<a href="http://objc.io/fpinswift/19">StackOverflow</a> has a fantastic list of
more recent research in this area.</p>
