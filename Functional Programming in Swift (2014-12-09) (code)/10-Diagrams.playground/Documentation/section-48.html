    <p>By adding these small helper functions, we have a powerful library for
drawing diagrams.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>The code in this chapter is inspired by the Diagrams library for Haskell
[@yorgey]. Although we can draw simple diagrams, there are many possible
improvements and extensions to the library we have presented here. Some
things are still missing but can be added easily. For example, it&#39;s
straightforward to add more attributes and styling options. A bit more
complicated would be adding transformations (such as rotation), but this
is certainly still possible.</p>
<p>When we compare the library that we&#39;ve built in this chapter to the
library in <a href="#thinking-functionally">Chapter 2</a>, we can see many
similarities. Both take a problem domain (regions and diagrams) and
create a small library of functions to describe this domain. Both
libraries provide an interface through functions that are highly
composable. Both of these little libraries define a <em>domain-specific
language</em> (or DSL) embedded in Swift. A DSL is a small programming
language, tailored to solve a particular problem. You are probably
already familiar with lots of DSLs, such as regular expressions, SQL, or
HTML â€” each of these languages is not a general-purpose programming
language in which to write <em>any</em> application, but instead is more
restricted to solve a particular kind of problem. Regular expressions
are used for describing patterns or lexers, SQL is used for querying a
database, and HTML is used for describing the content of a webpage.</p>
<p>However, there is an important difference between the two DSLs: in the
<a href="#thinking-functionally">Thinking Functionally</a> chapter, we created
functions that return a bool for each position. To draw the diagrams, we
built up an intermediate structure, the <code>Diagram</code> enum. A <em>shallow
embedding</em> of a DSL in a general-purpose programming language like Swift
does not create any intermediate data structures. A <em>deep embedding</em>, on
the other hand, explicitly creates an intermediate data structure, like
the <code>Diagram</code> enumeration described in this chapter. The term
&#39;embedding&#39; refers to how the DSL for regions or diagrams are &#39;embedded&#39;
into Swift. Both have their advantages. A shallow embedding can be
easier to write, there is less overhead during execution, and it can be
easier to extend with new functions. However, when using a deep
embedding, we have the advantage that we can analyze an entire
structure, transform it, or assign different meanings to the
intermediate data structure.</p>
<p>If we would rewrite the DSL from Chapter 2 to use deep embedding
instead, we would need to define an enumeration representing the
different functions from the library. There would be members for our
primitive regions, like circles or squares, and members for composite
regions, such as those formed by intersection or union. We could then
analyze and compute with these regions in different ways: generating
images, checking whether a region is primitive or not, determining
whether or not a given point is in the region, or performing an
arbitrary computation over this intermediate data structure. Rewriting
the diagrams library to a shallow embedding would be complicated. The
intermediate data structure can be inspected, modified, and transformed.
To define a shallow embedding, we would need to call Core Graphics
directly for every operation that we wish to support in our DSL. It is
much more difficult to compose drawing calls than it is to first create
an intermediate structure and only render it once the diagram has been
completely assembled.</p>
