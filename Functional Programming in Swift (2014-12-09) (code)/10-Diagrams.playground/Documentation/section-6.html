    <p>The code above first describes a blue square with a relative size of
<code>1</code>. The red square is twice as big (it has a relative size of <code>2</code>). We
compose the diagram by putting the squares and the circle next to each
other with the <code>|||</code> operator. Changing this diagram is very simple, and
there&#39;s no need to worry about calculating frames or moving things
around. The examples describe <em>what</em> should be drawn, not <em>how</em> it
should be drawn.</p>
<p>One of the techniques we&#39;ll use in this chapter is building up an
intermediate structure of the diagram. Instead of executing the drawing
commands immediately, we build up a data structure that describes the
diagram. This is a very powerful technique, as it allows us to inspect
the data structure, modify it, and convert it into different formats.</p>
<p>As a more complex example of a diagram generated by the same library,
Figure \ref{fig:diagram3} shows a bar graph.</p>
<p><em>Playgrounds don&#39;t contain images, please see the book</em></p>
<p>We can write a <code>barGraph</code> function that takes a list of names (the keys)
and values (the relative heights of the bars). For each value in the
dictionary, we draw a suitably sized rectangle. We then horizontally
concatenate these rectangles with the <code>hcat</code> function. Finally, we put
the bars and the text below each other using the <code>---</code> operator:</p>
