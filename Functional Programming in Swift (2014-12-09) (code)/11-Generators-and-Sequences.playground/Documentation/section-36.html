    <p>Similarly, we may of course want to filter out certain elements from a
sequence.</p>
<p>It is worth pointing out that these <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> functions do
<em>not</em> return new sequences, but instead traverse the sequence to produce
an array. Mathematicians may therefore object to calling such operations
<code>map</code>s, as they fail to leave the underlying structure (a sequence)
intact. There are separate versions of <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> that do
produce sequences. These are defined as extensions of the <code>LazySequence</code>
class. A <code>LazySequence</code> is a simple wrapper around regular sequences:</p>
<pre><code>func lazy&lt;S: SequenceType&gt;(s: S) -&gt; LazySequence&lt;S&gt;
</code></pre><p>If you need to map or filter sequences that may produce either infinite
results, or many results that you may not be interested in, be sure to
use a <code>LazySequence</code> rather than a <code>Sequence</code>. Failing to do so could
cause your program to diverge or take much longer than you might expect.</p>
<h2 id="case-study-traversing-a-binary-tree">Case Study: Traversing a Binary Tree</h2>
<p>To illustrate sequences and generators, we will consider defining a
traversal on a binary tree. Recall our definition of binary trees from
