<p>In this chapter, we&#39;ll look at generators and sequences. These form the
machinery underlying Swift&#39;s for loops, and will be the basis of the
parsing library that we will present in the following chapters.</p>
<h2 id="generators">Generators</h2>
<p>In Objective-C and Swift, we almost always use the <code>Array</code> datatype to
represent a list of items. It is both simple and fast. There are
situations, however, where arrays are not suitable. For example, you
might not want to calculate all the elements of an array, because there
is an infinite amount, or you donâ€™t expect to use them all. In such
situations, you may want to use a <em>generator</em> instead.</p>
<p>We will try to provide some motivation for generators, using familiar
examples from array computations. Swift&#39;s for loops can be used to
iterate over array elements:</p>
<pre><code>for x in xs {
    // do something with x
}
</code></pre><p>In such a for loop, the array is traversed from beginning to end. There
may be examples, however, where you want to traverse arrays in a
different order. This is where generators may be useful.</p>
<p>Conceptually, a generator is a &#39;process&#39; that generates new array
elements on request. A generator is any type that adheres to the
following protocol:</p>
<pre><code>protocol GeneratorType {
    typealias Element
    func next() -&gt; Element?
}
</code></pre><p>This protocol requires an <em>associated type</em>, <code>Element</code>, defined by the
<code>GeneratorType</code>. There is a single method, <code>next</code>, that produces the
next element if it exists, and <code>nil</code> otherwise.</p>
<p>For example, the following generator produces array indices, starting
from the end of an array until it reaches 0:</p>
