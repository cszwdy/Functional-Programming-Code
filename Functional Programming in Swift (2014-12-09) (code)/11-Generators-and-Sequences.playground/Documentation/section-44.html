    <p>If the tree has no elements, we return an empty generator. If the tree
has a node, we combine the results of the two recursive calls, together
with the single value stored at the root, using the append operator on
generators.</p>
<h2 id="case-study-better-shrinking-in-quickcheck">Case Study: Better Shrinking in QuickCheck</h2>
<p>In this section, we will provide a somewhat larger case study of
defining sequences, by improving the <code>Smaller</code> protocol we implemented
in the <a href="#quickcheck">QuickCheck chapter</a>. Originally, the protocol was
defined as follows:</p>
<pre><code>protocol Smaller {
    func smaller() -&gt; Self?
}
</code></pre><p>We used the <code>Smaller</code> protocol to try and shrink counterexamples that
our testing uncovered. The <code>smaller</code> function is repeatedly called to
generate a smaller value; if this value still fails the test, it is
considered a &#39;better&#39; counterexample than the original one. The
<code>Smaller</code> instance we defined for arrays simply tried to repeatedly
strip off the first element:</p>
<pre><code>extension Array: Smaller {
    func smaller() -&gt; [T]? {
        if (!self.isEmpty) {
            return Array(dropFirst(self))
        }
        return nil
    }
}
</code></pre><p>While this will certainly help shrink counterexamples in <em>some</em> cases,
there are many different ways to shrink an array. Computing all possible
subarrays is an expensive operation. For an array of length <code>n</code>, there
are <code>2^n</code> possible subarrays that may or may not be interesting
counterexamples â€” generating and testing them is not a good idea.</p>
<p>Instead, we will show how to use a generator to produce a series of
smaller values. We can then adapt our QuickCheck library to use the
following protocol:</p>
