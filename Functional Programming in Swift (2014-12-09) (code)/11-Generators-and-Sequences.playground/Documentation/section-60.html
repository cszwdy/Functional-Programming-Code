    <p>In addition to generating sublists, this new version of the <code>smaller</code>
function also produces arrays, where the values of the elements are
smaller.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-map-and-filter">Beyond Map and Filter</h2>
<p>In the coming chapter, we will need a few more operations on sequences
and generators. To define those operations, we need the <code>SequenceOf</code>
struct, defined analogously to the <code>GeneratorOf</code> we saw previously.
Essentially, it wraps any function that returns a generator in a
sequence. It is (more or less) defined as follows:</p>
<pre><code>struct SequenceOf&lt;T&gt; : SequenceType {
    init&lt;G : GeneratorType&gt;(_ makeUnderlyingGenerator: () -&gt; G)

    func generate() -&gt; GeneratorOf&lt;T&gt;
}
</code></pre><p>We have already defined concatenation, using the <code>+</code> operator, on
generators. A first attempt at defining concatenation for sequences
might result in the following definition:</p>
<pre><code>func +&lt;A&gt;(l: SequenceOf&lt;A&gt;, r: SequenceOf&lt;A&gt;) -&gt; SequenceOf&lt;A&gt; {
  return SequenceOf(l.generate() + r.generate())
}
</code></pre><p>This definition calls the generate method of the two argument sequences,
concatenates these, and assigns the resulting generator to the sequence.
Unfortunately, it does not quite work as expected. Consider the
following example:</p>
<pre><code>let s = SequenceOf([1, 2, 3]) + SequenceOf([4, 5, 6])
print(&quot;First pass: &quot;)
for x in s {
    print(x)
}
println(&quot;\nSecond pass:&quot;)
for x in s {
    print(x)
}
</code></pre><p>We construct a sequence containing the elements <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</code> and
traverse it twice, printing the elements we encounter. Somewhat
surprisingly perhaps, this code produces the following output:</p>
<pre><code>First pass: 123456
Second pass:
</code></pre><p>The second for loop is not producing any output â€” what went wrong? The
problem is in the definition of concatenation on sequences. We assemble
the desired generator, <code>l.generate() + r.generate()</code>. This generator
produces all the desired elements in the first loop in the example
above. Once it has been exhausted, however, traversing the compound
sequence a second time will not produce a fresh generator, but instead
use the generator that has already been exhausted.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this problem is easy to fix. We need to ensure that the
result of our concatenation operation can produce new generators. To do
so, we pass a <em>function</em> that produces generators, rather than passing a
fixed generator to the <code>SequenceOf</code> initializer:</p>
<pre><code>func +&lt;A&gt;(l: SequenceOf&lt;A&gt;, r: SequenceOf&lt;A&gt;) -&gt; SequenceOf&lt;A&gt; {
  return SequenceOf { l.generate() + r.generate() }
}
</code></pre><p>Now, we can iterate over the same sequence multiple times. When writing
your own methods that combine sequences, it is important to ensure that
every call to <code>generate()</code> produces a fresh generator that is oblivious
to any previous traversals.</p>
<p>Thus far, we can concatenate two sequences. What about flattening a
sequence of sequences? Before we deal with sequences, let&#39;s try writing
a <code>join</code> operation that, given a <code>GeneratorOf&lt;GeneratorOf&lt;A&gt;&gt;</code>, produces
a <code>GeneratorOf&lt;A&gt;</code>:</p>
