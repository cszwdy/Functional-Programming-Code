    <p>However, our parser becomes notably slow as we add more and more
operators. This is because the parser is constantly <em>backtracking</em>: it
tries to parse something, then fails, and tries another alternative. For
example, when trying to parse <code>&quot;1+3*3&quot;</code>, first, the <code>&quot;-&quot;</code> operator
(which consists of a <code>&quot;+&quot;</code> expression, followed by a <code>&quot;-&quot;</code> character,
and then another <code>&quot;+&quot;</code> expression) is tried. The first <code>&quot;+&quot;</code> expression
succeeds, but because no <code>&quot;-&quot;</code> character is found, it tries the
alternative: just a <code>&quot;+&quot;</code> expression. If we continue this, we can see
that a lot of unnecessary work is being done.</p>
<p>Writing a parser like the above is very simple. However, it is not very
efficient. If we take a step back and look at the grammar we&#39;ve defined
using our parser combinators, we could write it down like this (in a
pseudo-grammar description language):</p>
<pre><code>expression = min
min = add &quot;-&quot; add | add
add = div &quot;+&quot; div | div
div = mul &quot;/&quot; mul | mul
mul = num &quot;*&quot; num | num
</code></pre><p>To remove a lot of the duplication, we can refactor the grammar like
this:</p>
<pre><code>expression = min
min = add (&quot;-&quot; add)?
add = div (&quot;+&quot; div)?
div = mul (&quot;/&quot; mul)?
mul = num (&quot;*&quot; num)?
</code></pre><p>Before we define the new operator function, we first define an
additional variant of the <code>&lt;/&gt;</code> operator that consumes but doesn&#39;t use
its right operand:</p>
