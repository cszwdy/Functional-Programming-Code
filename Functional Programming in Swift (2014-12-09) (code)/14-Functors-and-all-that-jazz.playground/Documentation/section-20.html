    <p>The <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> operator allows us to take an element <code>x</code> from the first
array, <code>xs</code>; next, we take an element <code>y</code> from <code>ys</code>. For each pair of
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, we return the array <code>[(x, y)]</code>. The <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> operator handles
combining all these arrays into one large result.</p>
<p>While this example may seem a bit contrived, the <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> operator on
arrays has many important applications. Languages like Haskell and
Python support special syntactic sugar for defining lists, called <em>list
comprehensions</em>. These list comprehensions allow you to draw elements
from existing lists and check that these elements satisfy certain
properties. They can all be desugared into a combination of maps,
filters, and <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>.</p>

<p>Why care about these things? Does it really matter if you know that some
type is an applicative functor or a monad? We think it does.</p>
<p>Consider the parser combinators from <a href="#parser-combinators">Chapter 12</a>.
Defining the correct way to sequence two parsers is not easy: it
requires a bit of insight into how parsers work. Yet it is an absolutely
essential piece of our library, without which we could not even write
the simplest parsers. If you have the insight that our parsers form an
applicative functor, you may realize that the existing <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> provides
you with exactly the right notion of sequencing two parsers, one after
the other. Knowing what abstract operations your types support can help
you find such complex definitions.</p>
<p>Abstract notions, like functors, provide important vocabulary. If you
ever encounter a function named <code>map</code>, you can probably make a pretty
good guess as to what it does. Without a precise terminology for common
structures like functors, you would have to rediscover each new <code>map</code>
function from scratch.</p>
<p>These structures give guidance when designing your own API. If you
define a generic enumeration or struct, chances are that it supports a
<code>map</code> operation. Is this something that you want to expose to your
users? Is your data structure also an applicative functor? Is it a
monad? What do the operations do? Once you familiarize yourself with
these abstract structures, you see them pop up again and again.</p>
<p>Although it is harder in Swift than in Haskell, you can define generic
functions that work on any applicative functor. Functions such as the
<code>&lt;/&gt;</code> operator on parsers were defined exclusively in terms of the
applicative <code>pure</code> and <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> functions. As a result, we may want to
redefine them for <em>other</em> applicative functors aside from parsers. In
this way, we recognize common patterns in how we program using these
abstract structures; these patterns may themselves be useful in a wide
variety of settings.</p>
<p>The historical development of monads in the context of functional
programming is interesting. Initially, monads were developed in a branch
of Mathematics known as <em>category theory</em>. The discovery of their
relevance to Computer Science is generally attributed to @moggi and
later popularized by Wadler [-@wadler-monads-1; -@wadler-monads-2].
Since then, they have been used by functional languages such as Haskell
to contain side effects and I/O [@spj]. Applicative functors were first
described by McBride and Paterson [-@mcbride-paterson], although there
were many examples already known. A complete overview of the relation
between many of the abstract concepts described in this chapter can be
found in the Typeclassopedia [@yorgey-typeclassopedia].</p>
